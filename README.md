# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript: handling null values.  The `foo` function in `bug.js` shows a simple but effective way to handle null values to prevent runtime errors or unexpected outputs.

The solution is in `bugSolution.js`, the code handles the edge case that could occur if the addition operation were performed with a null value. It checks for null values and returns null if either input is null.
